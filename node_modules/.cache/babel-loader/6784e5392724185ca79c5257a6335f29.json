This part of the assessment will take around 1 hour, including time for breaks. You will be shown an information page explaining what the study involves and you are free to contact the researcher(s) should you have any questions. You will need to give explicit consent by clicking a button on the consent page affirming that you are happy to take part in the study. We will then start the assessment.<br/><br/>As for the other part of the assessment, you will be invited for an assessment day in London (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging in central London or at the Anna Freud Centre, Hampstead/ Kings Cross). This part of the assessment will take around 2 hours, including time for breaks. When you arrive, we will explain what the study involves and you can ask questions. You will need to sign a consent form saying that you are happy to take part in the study. We will then start the assessment. The order of the components of the entire assessment can vary, but it will include these parts:<br/><br/><b>1. Questions on how you feel and act.</b> You will be given questionnaires to fill out. You will also have an interview where we talk about your moods and feelings. We would like to record the interview. The recordings will be used for training, quality control, audit, and research purposes. The recordings will be stored anonymously, using password-protected software. You can ask for the recordings to be stopped or deleted at any time. We only record the interviews if you are happy for us to do so. You do not have to answer anything which makes you feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/><b>2. Computer games to play.</b> You will play up to six different games (we call these 'tasks'). Before you take part we will explain each task we would like you to play. In all tasks you make decisions and choices such as ‘Is there more gold or silver fishes in the lake?’, or ‘Should I hide or collect more points?’. There are other choices too depending on the task you play. In most of the tasks you try to win points, which are usually converted to money. You will be told beforehand if this is the case. There will be times when you need to avoid losing in the games. Losing will mean brief, mildly painful electrical stimulation (we have attached more information about the electrical stimulation). We will show you what will happen before you begin the task and check you are happy to continue.<br/><br/><b>3. Pictures of your brain.</b> We will look at activity from your brain using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner. We may simultaneously collect data using Electroencephalography (EEG). Please look at the additional sheet, which tells you all about the scan you will be having. We will ask you to play some tasks on the computer and see how your brain activity changes.<br/><br/>During the tasks we may ask to record ‘physiological measures’. These show how your body reacts to playing the tasks and help us understand how you are feeling. Depending on the task we may record how fast your heart beats, how your eyes and muscles react or the moisture in your skin. We record pupil size with a camera and record the others by using sticky patches on the skin. These patches are harmless - they record activity underneath them. The patches are put on your arm and hands, or sometimes on your face, if we want to record eye movement. You will see the patches before they are put on and we will check to make sure you are comfortable.</p>\"\n        }, {\n          type: \"html\",\n          name: \"info\",\n          html: \"<b>Payment</b>\"\n        }, {\n          type: \"html\",\n          name: \"info\",\n          html: \"<p>If you complete everything the study will take around 3 hours and you will receive at least £50 for the inconvenience of taking part.

If you feel uncomfortable, you can always let us know and we will stop the scanning immediately and take you out.

This part of the assessment will take around 1 hour, including time for breaks. You will be shown an information page explaining what the study involves and you are free to contact the researcher(s) should you have any questions. You will need to give explicit consent by clicking a button on the consent page affirming that you are happy to take part in the study. We will then start the assessment.<br/><br/>As for the other part of the assessment, you will be invited for an assessment day in London (Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging in central London or at the Anna Freud Centre, Hampstead/ Kings Cross). This part of the assessment will take around 2 hours, including time for breaks. When you arrive, we will explain what the study involves and you can ask questions. You will need to sign a consent form saying that you are happy to take part in the study. We will then start the assessment. The order of the components of the entire assessment can vary, but it will include these parts:<br/><br/><b>1. Questions on how you feel and act.</b> You will be given questionnaires to fill out. You will also have an interview where we talk about your moods and feelings. We would like to record the interview. The recordings will be used for training, quality control, audit, and research purposes. The recordings will be stored anonymously, using password-protected software. You can ask for the recordings to be stopped or deleted at any time. We only record the interviews if you are happy for us to do so. You do not have to answer anything which makes you feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/><b>2. Computer games to play.</b> You will play up to six different games (we call these 'tasks'). Before you take part we will explain each task we would like you to play. In all tasks you make decisions and choices such as ‘Is there more gold or silver fishes in the lake?’, or ‘Should I hide or collect more points?’. There are other choices too depending on the task you play. In most of the tasks you try to win points, which are usually converted to money. You will be told beforehand if this is the case. There will be times when you need to avoid losing in the games. Losing will mean brief, mildly painful electrical stimulation (we have attached more information about the electrical stimulation). We will show you what will happen before you begin the task and check you are happy to continue.<br/><br/><b>3. Pictures of your brain.</b> We will look at activity from your brain using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanner. We may simultaneously collect data using Electroencephalography (EEG). Please look at the additional sheet, which tells you all about the scan you will be having. We will ask you to play some tasks on the computer and see how your brain activity changes.<br/><br/>During the tasks we may ask to record ‘physiological measures’. These show how your body reacts to playing the tasks and help us understand how you are feeling. Depending on the task we may record how fast your heart beats, how your eyes and muscles react or the moisture in your skin. We record pupil size with a camera and record the others by using sticky patches on the skin. These patches are harmless - they record activity underneath them. The patches are put on your arm and hands, or sometimes on your face, if we want to record eye movement. You will see the patches before they are put on and we will check to make sure you are comfortable.</p>\",\n            },\n            {\n              type: \"html\",\n              name: \"info\",\n              html: \"<b>Payment</b>\",\n            },\n\n            {\n              type: \"html\",\n              name: \"info\",\n              html:\n                \"<p>If you complete everything the study will take around 3 hours and you will receive at least £50 for the inconvenience of taking part.
